    <h2>What is Ceaseless?</h2>

  <p class="lead">CeaselessLite helps leaders like you pray for your people by sending you an e-mail with 3 people each day.
  We want to help followers of Jesus fulfill their priestly ministry of prayer.</p>

  <section id="why">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h2>Why do I want it?</h2>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">You&rsquo;re busy and it&rsquo;s hard to remember to pray for others. Prayer lists grow so long they start to feel overwhelming to the point of guilt-ridden indifference.</p>

  <p>Ceaseless helps you overcome these problems by giving you something to look forward to each morning: a short list of people to pray for. By helping you regularly pray for others over the long term, you can experience the joy of seeing God bless the people under your care as you have asked Him to.</p>

  <section id="how">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h2>How do I use it?</h2>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">All you need to do is get added as an intercessor for your group. At around 5am the
  next day you should receive an e-mail with a Scripture related to prayer and several people to pray for. If there are no members of your group you will need to add their names to that list first.</p>

  <section id="how-to-support">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h2>How can I support Ceaseless?</h2>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">You can support Ceaseless in four ways.</p>

  <p>First, please pray for us! Like you, we
  go through the ups and downs of life and sometimes question whether or not we are pursuing the Lord
  or our own ideas. Please pray that the Lord would encourage and strengthen us for the work he has
  given us to do. Please pray that we would honor him and effectively serve you with our work instead
  of merely seeking our own interests and advancement.</p>

  <p>Second, please give us your feedback! We love to hear from our users about how Ceaseless is helping
  them fulfill their priestly ministry of prayer. We also want to know when things aren't working well
  or when you have any concerns or ideas. You can reach us <a href="mailto:ceaseless@theotech.org">here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Third, if you've benefited from using Ceaseless, please share it with others! We want to help
  followers of Jesus pray for others amidst the busyness of daily life, but we cannot do so without
  your help sharing it.</p>

  <p>Fourth, if you want to give money to support Ceaseless, you can do so <a href="https://www.gittip.com/chrislim/">here</a>.
  We aren't an incorporated non-profit, so there are no tax benefits, but you can have the joy of
  investing in our team and this project as it helps promote God's desire that his people
  pray without ceasing.</p>

  <p>Lastly, (I know I said four ways, but I thought of one more!) if you have creative ideas for how
  you can help, like writing a review or sharing Ceaseless with your small group or church or
  conference, or writing code or something else, please let us know <a
    href="mailto:ceaseless@theotech.org">here</a>.
